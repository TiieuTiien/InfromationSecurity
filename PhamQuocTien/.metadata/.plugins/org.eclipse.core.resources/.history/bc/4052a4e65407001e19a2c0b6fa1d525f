# The RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) cipher is a widely used public-key encryption algorithm.
Here's a step-by-step explanation of how RSA encryption and decryption work:

Step 1: Key Generation

1. Choose two distinct prime numbers, p and q.
2. Compute their product, n = p * q. This is the modulus for both the public and private keys.
3. Compute Euler's totient function, φ(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1), which represents the number of positive integers less than n that are coprime to n.
4. Choose an integer e such that 1 < e < φ(n), and e is coprime with φ(n). This is the public exponent, which forms the public key.
5. Compute the modular multiplicative inverse of e modulo φ(n). This is an integer d, such that (d * e) % φ(n) = 1. d is the private exponent, forming the private key.

Step 2: Encryption

1. Convert the plaintext message to a numerical representation. This can be done using various techniques such as ASCII or Unicode.
2. Apply the public key (e, n) to encrypt the plaintext message. Calculate the ciphertext, C, using the formula C = M^e mod n, where M is the plaintext message and ^ denotes exponentiation modulo n.

Step 3: Decryption

 + Apply the private key (d, n) to decrypt the ciphertext. Calculate the plaintext message, M, using the formula M = C^d mod n, where C is the ciphertext and ^ denotes exponentiation modulo n.

Step 4: Message Integrity and Authentication (optional)

 + To ensure message integrity and authentication, digital signatures can be used. The sender can sign the message using their private key and the receiver can verify the signature using the sender's public key.

That's a high-level overview of the RSA cipher. The security of RSA is based on the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers into their prime factors.
