# The Affine cipher is a type of substitution cipher that operates on the letters of the alphabet.
It is a relatively simple encryption technique that involves a mathematical function with two components: a multiplication and an addition.

# Here's a step-by-step explanation of the Affine cipher:

**Encryption**
1. Choose two key components: 'a' and 'b'.
+ 'a' must be coprime with 26 (i.e., it should not have any common factors with 26).
+ 'b' can be any integer.
2. Take the plaintext letter, 'P'.
3. Apply the encryption formula: C = (a * P + b) mod 26.
+ 'C' represents the corresponding ciphertext letter.
+ The modulus operation ensures that 'C' stays within the range of the alphabet (26 letters).
4. Repeat steps 2-3 for each letter in the plaintext to obtain the complete ciphertext.
**Decryption**
1. Calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of 'a' modulo 26. Let's denote it as 'a^(-1)'.
+ The multiplicative inverse exists only if 'a' is coprime with 26.
2. Take the ciphertext letter, 'C'.
3. Apply the decryption formula: P = (a^(-1) * (C - b)) mod 26.
+ 'P' represents the corresponding plaintext letter.
+ The modulus operation ensures that 'P' stays within the range of the alphabet.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 for each letter in the ciphertext to obtain the complete plaintext.

#Note: 'a' and 'b' must be the same values used during encryption for decryption to work correctly.

Please ensure that the necessary calculations, such as finding the modular multiplicative inverse and performing the modulus operation, are correctly implemented in the programming language or tool you are using to apply the Affine cipher.

Keep in mind that the Affine cipher is a relatively weak encryption method and can be easily broken by modern cryptographic techniques.
