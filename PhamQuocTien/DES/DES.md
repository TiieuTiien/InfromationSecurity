# The DES (Data Encryption Standard) cipher.
The DES cipher is a symmetric encryption algorithm that was widely used for secure communications and data protection.
It was developed by IBM in the 1970s and later adopted by the U.S. government as a federal standard for encryption.

DES operates on 64-bit blocks of data and uses a 56-bit key for encryption and decryption. The algorithm consists of several rounds of operations that involve permutations, substitutions, and bitwise operations.

# Here's a step-by-step explanation of the DES cipher encryption process:

**1. Key Generation:**

- Start with a 64-bit encryption key, where the least significant bit of each byte is a parity bit (for error checking) and is ignored during encryption.
- Apply a key permutation, called the "PC-1" table, which selects 56 bits from the original 64-bit key.
- Divide the 56-bit key into two 28-bit halves: C<sub>0</sub> and D<sub>0</sub>.

**2. Round Key Generation:**

- Perform a left circular shift on C<sub>0</sub> and D<sub>0</sub> to create C<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>1</sub>. The number of positions shifted depends on the round number.
- Apply a key permutation, called the "PC-2" table, to combine C<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>1</sub> and generate a 48-bit subkey for each round.

**3. Initial Permutation (IP):**

- Apply an initial permutation to the 64-bit plaintext block using the "IP" table. This rearranges the bits according to a predefined pattern.

**4. Feistel Structure:**

- Divide the permuted plaintext into two 32-bit halves: L<sub>0</sub> (left) and R<sub>0</sub> (right).
Perform 16 rounds of the Feistel network.

**5. Round Function:**

- For each round:
  - Expand the 32-bit R<sub>n-1</sub> half into a 48-bit block using the "Expansion" table.
  - XOR the expanded block with the corresponding 48-bit subkey K<sub>n</sub>.
  - Divide the result into eight 6-bit blocks and pass them through eight S-boxes.
  - Each S-box takes a 6-bit input and produces a 4-bit output based on its own lookup table.
  - Combine the 4-bit outputs from the S-boxes to obtain a 32-bit block.
  - Permute the 32-bit block using the "Permutation" table.
  - XOR the permuted block with the L<sub>n-1</sub> half.
  - Swap the values of L<sub>n-1</sub> and R<sub>n-1</sub>, so R<sub>n-1</sub> becomes L<sub>n</sub> and the XOR result becomes R<sub>n</sub>.

**6. Final Permutation (FP):**

- After the 16 rounds, you will have two halves: the left half L<sub>16</sub> and the right half R<sub>16</sub>, we reverse the order of these two blocks. After that swap two halves for the final swap, the new left half becomes the previous right half, and the new right half becomes the previous left half.
- Apply the final permutation, which is the inverse of the initial permutation, using the "IP<sup>-1</sup>" table (other name is "FP" table).

**7. Output:**

- The resulting 64-bit block is the encrypted ciphertext.

The decryption process in DES is similar to encryption, but the subkeys are used in reverse order, starting with the 16th subkey. The round function is applied in the same way, but the input and output halves are swapped after each round. The final ciphertext is decrypted to obtain the original plaintext.
