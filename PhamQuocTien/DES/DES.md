# The DES (Data Encryption Standard) cipher.
The DES cipher is a symmetric encryption algorithm that was widely used for secure communications and data protection.
It was developed by IBM in the 1970s and later adopted by the U.S. government as a federal standard for encryption.

DES operates on 64-bit blocks of data and uses a 56-bit key for encryption and decryption. The algorithm consists of several rounds of operations that involve permutations, substitutions, and bitwise operations.

# Here's a step-by-step explanation of the DES cipher encryption process:

1. Key Generation:

- Start with a 64-bit encryption key, where the least significant bit of each byte is a parity bit (for error checking) and is ignored during encryption.
- Apply a key permutation, called the "PC-1" table, which selects 56 bits from the original 64-bit key.
- Divide the 56-bit key into two 28-bit halves: C0 and D0.

2. Round Key Generation:

- Perform a left circular shift on C0 and D0 to create C1 and D1. The number of positions shifted depends on the round number.
- Apply a key permutation, called the "PC-2" table, to combine C1 and D1 and generate a 48-bit subkey for each round.

3. Initial Permutation (IP):

- Apply an initial permutation to the 64-bit plaintext block using the "IP" table. This rearranges the bits according to a predefined pattern.

4. Feistel Structure:

- Divide the permuted plaintext into two 32-bit halves: L0 (left) and R0 (right).
Perform 16 rounds of the Feistel network.

5. Round Function:

- For each round:
  - Expand the 32-bit Rn-1 half into a 48-bit block using the "Expansion" table.
  - XOR the expanded block with the corresponding 48-bit subkey Kn.
  - Divide the result into eight 6-bit blocks and pass them through eight S-boxes.
  - Each S-box takes a 6-bit input and produces a 4-bit output based on its own lookup table.
  - Combine the 4-bit outputs from the S-boxes to obtain a 32-bit block.
  - Permute the 32-bit block using the "Permutation" table.
  - XOR the permuted block with the Ln-1 half.
  - Swap the values of Ln-1 and Rn-1, so Rn-1 becomes Ln and the XOR result becomes Rn.

6. Final Permutation (FP):

- After the 16 rounds, combine the final Ln and Rn halves into a single 64-bit block.
- Apply the final permutation, which is the inverse of the initial permutation, using the "FP" table.

7. Output:

- The resulting 64-bit block is the encrypted ciphertext.

The decryption process in DES is similar to encryption, but the subkeys are used in reverse order, starting with the 16th subkey. The round function is applied in the same way, but the input and output halves are swapped after each round. The final ciphertext is decrypted to obtain the original plaintext.
